 * Reference implementation of "split_FindBound()" function intended
 * for splitting of FASTA files (FASTA is a bioinformatics format for
 * representing nucleotide or peptide sequences). The function
 * recognizes the simplest version of the format:
 * ">IDENTIFIER\n"
 * "SEQUENCE\n"
 *
 * To split files of a different format, one needs to replace the
 * contents of the function with appropriate code

 * Short description of supported file format. This value will be

/**
 * Find actual bound of an element inside a buffer. The actual bound
 * should preferably be close to a projected bound
 *
 * Input: buff - pointer to the buffer
 *        projected_bound - desired offset of an element's last byte
 *        buff_size - buffer size
 *        is_first_block - indicator that a new output file will be started
 *                         with the data in the buffer (i.e. we're going
 *                         to write first chunk of the file)
 *
 * Return value: offset relative to "buff" if element bound was found, or
 *               SPLIT_BOUND_NOT_FOUND in the opposite case.
 *               "offset" should be from "-1" to "buff_size - 1".
 *               "-1" means that first byte of "buff" concides with first
 *               byte of some element and we want to finish current output
 *               file without adding any "buff" contents to it. This implies
 *               that the output file already contains an integer number of
 *               "elements". This is only possible when we don't start a
 *               new output file but continue adding data to already
 *               existing one. So, returning "-1" is only allowed when
 *               "is_first_block" indicator is "false". This is exactly the
 *               reason of having this indicator among the parameters: to
 *               allow to not add more data to an output file. Consider an
 *               example: buffer contents starts with a new element of
 *               size 100, projected bound is 10. The choice is adding 89
 *               to the desired size vs. subtracting 11. Subtracting 11
 *               might result in a better balancing of output file sizes
